          <span>Where the "Mardi Gras" is celebrated?</span>
          <span>
            The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans. Celebrations
            are
            concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the start
            of lent in
            the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many days
            have
            several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi
            Gras season. In
            the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and
            balls (some
            of them masquerade balls).

          <span>Purple Green and Gold</span>
          <span>
            The traditional colors of Mardi Gras are purple, green, and gold. These are said to have been chosen in 1892
            when the
            Rex Parade theme "Symbolism of Colors" gave the colors their meanings.
            Purple Represents Justice. Green Represents Faith. Gold Represents Power.

          <span>
            According to legend, Mardi Gras colors influenced the choice of school colors for archrivals Louisiana State
            University
            and Tulane University. They say when LSU was deciding on its colors, the shops in New Orleans had stocked up
            on purple,
            green, and gold for the Mardi Gras season. LSU decided upon purple and gold, and bought much of it. Tulane
            bought much
            of the only remaining color â€“ green.
