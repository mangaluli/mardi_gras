        Mardi Gras refers to events of the Carnival celebration, beginning on or after the Christian
        feasts of
        the Epiphany (Three Kings Day) and culminating on the day before Ash Wednesday, which is known as Shrove
        Tuesday. Mardi
        Gras is French for "Fat Tuesday", reflecting the practice of the last night of eating rich, fatty foods before
        the
        ritual Lenten sacrifices and fasting of the Lenten season.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify text-md lg:text-lg p-2">
        Related popular practices are associated with Shrovetide celebrations before the fasting and religious
        obligations
        associated with the penitential season of Lent. In countries such as the United Kingdom, Mardi Gras is more
        usually
        known as Pancake Day or (traditionally) Shrove Tuesday (derived from the word shrive, meaning "to administer the
        sacrament of confession to; to absolve").
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify text-md lg:text-lg p-2">
        The festival season varies from city to city, as some traditions, such as the one in New Orleans, Louisiana,
        consider
        Mardi Gras to stretch the entire period from Twelfth Night (the last night of Christmas which begins Epiphany)
        to Ash
        Wednesday. Others treat the final three-day period before Ash Wednesday as the Mardi Gras. In Mobile, Alabama,
        Mardi Grasâ€“associated social events begin in November, followed by mystic society balls on Thanksgiving, then
        New
        Year's Eve, followed by parades and balls in January and February, celebrating up to midnight before Ash
        Wednesday. In
        earlier times, parades were held on New Year's Day. Carnival is an important celebration in Anglican and
        Catholic
        European nations.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify text-md lg:text-lg p-2">
        Mardi Gras, as a celebration of life before the more-somber occasion of Ash Wednesday, nearly always involves
        the use of
        masks and costumes by its participants, and the most popular celebratory colors are purple, green, and gold. In
        New
        Orleans, for example, these often take the shape of fairies, animals, people from myths, or various Medieval
        costumes as well as clowns and Indians (Native Americans). However, many costumes today are simply elaborate
        creations of colored feathers and capes. Unlike Halloween costumery, Mardi Gras costumes are not usually
        associated with
        such things as zombies, mummies, bats, blood, and the like, though death may be a theme in some. The Venice
        tradition
        has brought golden masks into the usual round of costumes.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify text-md lg:text-lg p-2">
        Women exposing their breasts during Mardi Gras in New Orleans, US, has been documented since 1889, when the
        Times-Democrat decried the "degree of immodesty exhibited by nearly all female masqueraders seen on the
        streets." The
        practice was mostly limited to tourists in the upper Bourbon Street area. In the crowded streets of the French
        Quarter, generally avoided by locals on Mardi Gras Day, flashers on balconies cause crowds to form on the
        streets.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify text-md lg:text-lg p-2">
        In the last decades of the 20th century, the rise in producing commercial videotapes catering to voyeurs helped
        encourage a tradition of women baring their breasts in exchange for beads and trinkets. Social scientists
        studying
        "ritual disrobement" found, at Mardi Gras 1991, 1,200 instances of body-baring in exchange for beads or other
        favors.
