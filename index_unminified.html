          <span>Where the "Mardi Gras" is celebrated?</span>
          <span>
            The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans. Celebrations
            are
            concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the start
            of lent in
            the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many days
            have
            several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi
            Gras season. In
            the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and
            balls (some
            of them masquerade balls).

          <span>Purple Green and Gold</span>
          <span>
            The traditional colors of Mardi Gras are purple, green, and gold. These are said to have been chosen in 1892
            when the
            Rex Parade theme "Symbolism of Colors" gave the colors their meanings.
            Purple Represents Justice. Green Represents Faith. Gold Represents Power.
          </span>
          <span>
            According to legend, Mardi Gras colors influenced the choice of school colors for archrivals Louisiana State
            University
            and Tulane University. They say when LSU was deciding on its colors, the shops in New Orleans had stocked up
            on purple,
            green, and gold for the Mardi Gras season. LSU decided upon purple and gold, and bought much of it. Tulane
            bought much
            of the only remaining color – green.

          <span>Mardi Gras in New Orleans</span>
          <span>
            The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans. Celebrations
            are
            concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the start
            of lent in
            the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many days
            have
            several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi
            Gras season. In
            the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and
            balls (some
            of them masquerade balls).
          </span>
          <span>
            The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade
            schedule and route
            each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the Knights
            of Momus and
            the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and events
            (often featuring
            celebrity guests), such as the Krewe of Endymion, the Krewe of Bacchus, as well as the Zulu Social Aid &
            Pleasure Club—a
            predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most
            common throws are
            strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small
            inexpensive toys.
            Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each year.
          </span>
          <span>
            While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades originate in
            the Uptown and
            Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of the
            French
            Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take place downtown in the
            Faubourg
            Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras Day. Mardi Gras Day traditionally concludes
            with the
            "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.

          <span>Traditional colors</span>
          <span>
            The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans are purple, green, and gold. The colors
            were first
            specified in proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their inaugural parade in 1872,
            suggesting that
            balconies be draped in banners of these colors. It is unknown why these specific colors were chosen; some
            accounts
            suggest that they were initially selected solely on their aesthetic appeal, as opposed to any true
            symbolism.
          </span>
          <span>
            Errol Laborde, author of Marched the Day God: A History of the Rex Organization, presented a theory that the
            colors were
            based on heraldry: all three colors correspond to a heraldic tincture, and Rex's goal may have been to
            create a tricolor
            to represent their "kingdom". Purple was widely associated with royalty, while white was already heavily
            used on other
            national flags, and was thus avoided. Furthermore, he noted that a flag in green, gold and purple in that
            order complies
            with the rule of tincture, which states that metals (gold or silver) can only be placed on or next to other
            colors, and
            that colors cannot be placed on or next to other colors.
          </span>
          <span>
            Following a color-themed Rex parade in 1892 that featured purple, green, and gold-colored floats themed
            around the
            concepts, the Rex organization retroactively declared that the three colors in that order symbolized
            justice, power, and
            faith. The traditional colors are commonly addressed as purple, green, and gold, in that order—even though
            this order
            technically violates the rule of tincture.

          <span>Costumes and masks</span>
          <span>
            In New Orleans, costumes and masks are seldom publicly worn by non-Krewe members on the days before Fat
            Tuesday (other
            than at parties), but are frequently worn on Mardi Gras. Laws against concealing one's identity with a mask
            are
            suspended for the day. Banks are closed, and some businesses and other places with security concerns (such
            as
            convenience stores) post signs asking people to remove their masks before entering.

          <span>Public nudity</span>
          <span>
            Wearing less clothing than considered decent in other contexts during Mardi Gras has been documented since
            1889, when
            the Times-Democrat decried the "degree of immodesty exhibited by nearly all female masqueraders seen on the
            streets."
            Risqué costumes, including body painting, are fairly common. The practice of exposing female breasts in
            exchange for
            Mardi Gras beads, however, was mostly limited to tourists in the upper Bourbon Street area. In the
            crowded
            streets of the French Quarter, generally avoided by locals on Mardi Gras Day, flashers on balconies cause
            crowds to form
            on the streets.
          </span>
          <span>
            In the last decades of the 20th century, the rise in producing commercial videotapes catering to voyeurs
            helped
            encourage a tradition of women baring their breasts in exchange for beads and trinkets. Social scientists
            studying
            "ritual disrobement" found, at Mardi Gras 1991, 1,200 instances of body-baring in exchange for beads or
            other favors.

              When does Mardi Gras start and end?
            </span>
            <span>
              The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras day
              (Fat
              Tuesday),
              however, is on a different day each year.

              Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat Tuesday is
              always the
              day before Ash Wednesday.

              Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay through Ash
              Wednesday.

              What is the weather usually like during Mardi Gras?
            </span>
            <span>
              The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very warm, almost hot. Sometimes it will change
              from
              one
              extreme to the other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your clothes since a chilly morning
              may
              turn into a
              warm afternoon.

              Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can get somewhat
              dirty.
              Don’t
              forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then you’ll definitely want to bring a
              raincoat!

          <div class="qa">

              How much does it cost to go to Mardi Gras?
            </span>
            <span>
              It's free! Not only that, but you'll leave with bags of Mardi Gras beads and throws. That's why we call it
              the "Greatest
              Free Show on Earth!"

            </span>
            <span>
              The parades roll in light rain. The officials will only postpone if the weather is predicted to be severe.
              The local TV
              and radio news stations (such as WWL Radio) broadcast the hour-by-hour updates.
